							 <p class="hhistory">One of the more remarkable sights to see in San Jose is the Pre-Columbian Gold Museum.  Located under the Plaza de las Culturas, this national history museum was brought into existence as a donation by Costa Rica's Central Bank to preserve the country's history.  This museum's collection contains over 1600 individual pieces of pre-Columbian golden artwork that was made between 500AD and 1500AD.  This museum, containing pieces from multiple indigenous cultures of Latin America, is the home of a cultural treasure from the ancestors of modern day Costa Rica.<br>The Gold museum currently also houses another collection that, although not counted in troy ounces, is just as rich in cultural history.   This interesting exhibit contains hundreds of clay, stone, jade and yes, even some gold sculptures, of birds.  Birds, such as the Quetzal, have always been revered and respected, and the cultural affinity expressed through the intricate statues.

								 <p class="hhistory">The Plaza de la Cultura is a lively downtown square where the locals hang out, show off their musical skills, have their art on display, or feed the pigeons. It is surrounded by shopping and housing some of the major museums. You can visit many little vendors and even see some street entertainers. It is also a favorite spot in town among locals for marimba bands, jugglers, clowns, and the like. There is a lot of food to be eaten, as well as places to buy souvenirs. If you're lucky there will be a dance or music performance going on.The Teatro Nacional is to be found on the southern end of the plaza. You can also visit the Museo del Oro Precolumbino here. The Grand Hotel of Costa Rica is on the western side.

							<p class="hhistory">The Ruins of the Temple of the Santiago Apostol Parish are located at the city square of Costa Rica’s old capital city Cartago, about 22 kilometers east of the new capital San Jose. After several earthquakes time after time destroyed the temple, the city made the ruins into a garden.“Since the beginning of the evanelism period, different buildings were build on this place, all of them dedicated to Santiago Apostle, the first patron of Costa Rica. Each building that ever sheltered the temple was always destroyed by earthquakes.”“The construction of the current building started in 1870 and it was based on the plans made by the German architect Francisco Kurtz. The structure clearly reveals a Roman influence.
                            The ruins of the temple of Santiago Apóstol parish are the only example of this architecture in Costa Rica.” The construction stopped 1910 after the final earthquake.</p></div>

								   <p class="hhistory">The Poás Volcano, is an active 2,708-metre stratovolcano in central Costa Rica and is located within Poas Volcano National Park. It has erupted 40 times since 1828, including April 2017 when visitors and residents were evacuated. The volcano and surrounding park were closed for nearly 17 months, with a 2.5 kilometer safety perimeter established around the erupting crater. As of September 1, 2018 the park has reopened with limited access only to the crater observation area and requires a reservation to be made on the National Park Website. Adjacent trails to Lake Botos as well as the museum at the visitor center remained closed. The volcano erupted briefly twice in September 2019. </p></div>

											   <p class="hhistory">Located in the capital city of San Jose, the Costa Rica National Museum sits directly across from the country's Legislative Assembly. The museum is situated in the Bellavista Fortress, which was built in 1917 and originally used as military barracks, specifically during the 1948 Costa Rica civil war. Tourists visiting the museum can still see hundreds of bullet holes in the walls.<br>But while the museum did not open in its current location until 1950, it was originally created on May 4, 1887 in the building of the Universidad de Santo Tomas, with the intention of providing the country with a public establishment to "deposit, classify and study natural and artistic products."

						                      The Museo Nacional de Costa Rica was originally encouraged by the project of "order and progress," which reorganized the national culture through educational changes and the development of institutions with specific cultural and scientific purposes.</p>
